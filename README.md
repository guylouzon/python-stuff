# LTV Revenue Projection Model 

This Python code implements an Expected Lifetime Value (LTV) revenue projection model, as described in Eric Benjamin Seufert's article "Building a marketing P&L using LTV and ROAS". It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for generating visualizations of the projected revenue, spend, profit, and user growth over time.
